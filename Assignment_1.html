                <h4 >The Hava Mahal:</h4> 
                The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and
                pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's
                chambers.

                The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai
                Singh, the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan.[1] He was so inspired by the
                unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.

                It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small
                windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.[2] The original intent of the lattice
                design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below
                without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass
                through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.[2][3][4] Many
                people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the
                back.

            <h4>Taj Mahal:</h4>The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an
            ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was
            commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his
            favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of
            a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens
            bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the
            project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in
            1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹30
            billion.[7] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of
            architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor’s court architect. Various types of symbolism have been
            employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.

            <h4>Gateway of India</h4>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the
            city of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the
            first British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain.

            The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by
            elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet
            was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made
            of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well
            as Gujarati architecture of the time.

            <h4>Red Fort:</h4>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːl qiːlaː]) is a historic fort in the Old Delhi
            neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors.
            Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638, when he decided to shift his
            capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad
            Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah
            Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.

            The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739.
            Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian
            Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used
            as a garrison.

            Heritage Site located in Hampi (City), Vijayanagara district, east-central Karnataka, India.[2] Hampi
            predates the Vijayanagara Empire; it is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Puranas of Hinduism as Pampa Devi
            Tirtha Kshetra.[3][4] Hampi continues to be an important religious centre, housing the Virupaksha Temple, an
